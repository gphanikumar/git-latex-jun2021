MM2090 has been one of the best courses I have taken so far. We were introduced to several useful tools and softwares that is sure to help us in the long run.
Although the course lasted for about 2.5 months, the content covered was wide in variety and there were many learning opportunities. We were also encouraged 
to go beyond what was taught in class while we were solving the assignments. I would recommend everyone to take this amazing course. Thank you for giving me 
an opportunity to be part of it!

My experience of this course (MM2090) has been pretty amazing. We were introduced to so many things in such a short duration of time, which is really cool. I would never have thought that I would learn so much in one course.
Apart from the lectures, the assignments also have been very interesting, and I enjoyed solving them immensely. This course is hands down the best course I've taken so far.
